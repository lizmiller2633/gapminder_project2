This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```



```{r read-in-data}
gap.in<- read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep="\t", header=TRUE)

summary(gap.in)

gap.in %>% 
  #the pipe command in R is %>%, piping the gap.in into select function
  select(pop, country, year, continent) %>%
  filter(year == 2002) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(pop))

#this is faster than in built in R because it uses C++

```


```


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
